The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program exists to advance the global
understanding of health and population trends in developing countries.

The UN describes violence against women and girls (VAWG) as: “One of the most widespread,
persistent, and devastating human rights violations in our world today. It remains largely
unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma, and shame surrounding it.”

In general terms, it manifests itself in physical, sexual, and psychological forms, encompassing:
<p>• intimate partner violence (battering, psychological abuse, marital rape, femicide)</p>
<p>• sexual violence and harassment (rape, forced sexual acts, unwanted sexual advances,</p>
child sexual abuse, forced marriage, street harassment, stalking, cyber-harassment),</p>
human trafficking (slavery, sexual exploitation)
<p>• female genital mutilation</p>
<p>• child marriage</p>

<h2>About Data</h2>

The data was taken from a survey of men and women in African, Asian, and South American countries, exploring the attitudes and perceived justifications given for committing acts of violence against women. The data also explores different sociodemographic groups that the respondents belong to, including: Education Level, Marital status, Employment, and Age group.

It is, therefore, critical that the countries where these views are widespread, prioritize public
awareness campaigns, and access to education for women and girls, to communicate that
violence against women and girls is never acceptable or justifiable.

Question | Respondents were asked if they agreed with the following statements:

<p>A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she burns the food</p>
